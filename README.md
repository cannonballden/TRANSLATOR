# Elephant Translator (Prototype)

A conservative, evidence-based “translator” for **African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana)**.

Detects **vocalizations** (rumble, trumpet) and visible **body-language cues** (ear-spread proxy, approach, stillness), then outputs a **time-aligned play-by-play** and a concise **summary** with confidences.

## Ethics & limits
Not a language translator—maps cues to behavioral states. Declares uncertainty when evidence is weak.
